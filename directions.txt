0 - speed is zero
x - speed > 0
-x - speed < 0

x,-x,0: go forward
-x,x,0: should be "go backwards", but wheel 1 does not accept negative speeds for some reason
0,-x,0: go right
0,x,0: go right backwards (robot itself is turning left, but going rightwards)
x,0,0: go left
-x,0,0: should be "go left backwards", but wheel 1 does not accept negative speeds for some reason

0,0,x,0: turn left
0,0,-x,0: turn right
