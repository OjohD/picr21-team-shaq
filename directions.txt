0 - speed is zero
x - speed > 0
-x - speed < 0

Important ones:
!! x,-x,0: go forward
!! -x,x,0: should be "go backwards", but wheel 1 does not accept negative speeds for some reason
!! x,0,x: turn left on the same spot
!! 0,-x,-x: turn right on the same spot

!! 0,-x,0: go right
!! x,0,0: go left

0,x,0: go right backwards (robot itself is turning left, but going rightwards)
-x,0,0: should be "go left backwards", but wheel 1 does not accept negative speeds for some reason
0,0,x,0: turn left
0,0,-x,0: turn right
